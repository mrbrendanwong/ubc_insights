Final pass rate: 74.3%
Code coverage rate: src/controller/ (85.2%), DatasetController.js (93.94%), InsightFacade.js (85.06%), QueryController.js (83.04%)


On my end, I implemented the core functionality of the InsightFacade class and transferred all necessary code from RouterHandler to the aforementioned class. Furthermore, I implemented (at least attempted to) GROUP, APPLY and the edge-case handling for both of those.
