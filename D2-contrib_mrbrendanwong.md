# Brendon's Responsibilities
For D2, my main responsibilities were maintaining/updating the code in InsightFacade.ts and the ORDER method in QueryController.ts. For InsightFacade, this mainly focused on ensuring the keys in GET were now either part of GROUP or APPLY, and vice versa. For ORDER, the method was updated to handle the new format specified in D2. Other responsibilities included basic code design and preparation for a system rewrite. Unit tests for error codes for DELETE were also added to our test suite.
